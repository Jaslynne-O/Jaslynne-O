        <h2>Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Each action has a base temperature drop value, but the effectiveness of an action can be influenced by the actions performed before it.</li>
            <li>The program must evaluate all possible sequences of these actions to find the order that results in the greatest total temperature decrease.</li>
            <li>The input consists of the number of actions, the base temperature drop for each action, and a matrix representing how the temperature drop of one action is</li>
            <li>affected by the action performed immediately before it. The output is the sequence of actions (by their indices) that maximizes the total temperature reduction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Skills Learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>implementing brute force algorithms by generating and evaluating all permutations of a set of actions to find the optimal solution, and using recursion to systematically explore all possible sequences. </li>
          <li>The project also provided experience with backtracking to efficiently explore different action orders without repetition. Additionally, it improved skills in handling complex input</li>
          <li>and output, problem decomposition, and optimization thinking by evaluating and comparing different solutions. Furthermore, the project enhanced proficiency in C programming,</li>
          <li>particularly with arrays, recursion, and control structures, as well as debugging and testing recursive algorithms to ensure correctness.</li>
